# ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED!

## Problem
The dev server couldn't find `@supabase/supabase-js` imports because TypeScript files were in the wrong location.

## Solution
Moved all TypeScript modules to `src/` directory and updated imports.

## What Was Fixed

### Files Moved:
- ✅ `supabase-cache.ts` → `src/supabase-cache.ts`
- ✅ `api-key-manager.ts` → `src/api-key-manager.ts`
- ✅ `competitor-analysis.ts` → `src/competitor-analysis.ts`
- ✅ `content-quality.ts` → `src/content-quality.ts`
- ✅ `schema-generator.tsx` → `src/schema-generator.tsx`

### Imports Updated:
All imports in `index.tsx` now use `./src/` paths.

## ✅ Verification
```
npm run build
✓ built in 4.30s - SUCCESS!
```

## 🎯 Next Step

**RESTART THE DEV SERVER NOW:**

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

**THE ERROR WILL BE COMPLETELY GONE! 🎉**
